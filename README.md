</br>
APPROVED COMPLETED: 2023-03-06 - PASSED</br>
KYC COMPLETED: none</br>
CONTRACT AUDIT COMPLETED: none</br>
</br>
</br>
IS IT SAFE?</br>
</br>
YES: This project is considered safe from potential rugging (fraud) due to its APPROVED status.  While a full AML/PEP level KYC is not yet completed we do hold personal KYC information that identifies the person(s) and their address.  We do not know if they are or have ever been involved in fraud, money laundering or are of polical interest.</br>
</br>
RISKS: The projects contract(s) have not been audited and ownership has not been verified. However, the person(s) APPROVED are known to us and we consider this project low risk.
</br>
</br>
</br>
NOTES:</br>
</br>
 At the time of issuing this APPROVED badge the contract(s), liquidity pool(s), deployer wallet(s) and other wallets that control minting, withdrawals and other key functions have not been verified as belonging to the person(s) approved.  However, they are a "known" entity to us and we consider this project low risk.</br>
</br>
 A completed KYC as per LayerOne's standards is considered the one of the main safety factors in any project.  If this project has KYC's for all members with controlling wallets then we consider the project to be safe from potential rugging (a "rug" or "rugging" is fraud from within the team).</br>
</br>
Why is a project with a team KYC by LayerOne considered the safest kind of prject?</br>
</br>
 Our team of cybersecurity professionals along with the Counsel of International Investigators (CII) have a track record of finding criminals and cryptocurrency recovery.  CII is a group of over 400 internationally licensed private investigators in 72 countries.</br>
</br>
 If this project/person(s) has done a full KYC with us, we have their home address and government ID in our vault (securely stored).  Should a crime be established (a rug), and if a legal mandate is issued we can have boots on the ground in almost any country within 24-48hrs to track and arrest where possible.</br>
</br>
IMPORTANT: KYC information is stored securely in accordance with GDPR, POPIA and other international standards for privacy law.  It's sole use is to validate who a person is and we can only reveal this personal information for legal purposes and no other.</br>
